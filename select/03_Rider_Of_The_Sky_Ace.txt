Rider rider rider of the sky
Rider rider rider of the sky
Rider of the sky
Rider of the sky
Rider of the sky
Rider of the sky

I was born to be a legend
Dreamin' of the seventh heaven
Pretty baby I was born to fly (was born to fly)

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard, now baby
Rider of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Rider of the sky
Dartin' like a dream come true, star bright

In my mind I feel the rhythm
You can't stop this man from dreamin'
You can't stop my flight
Into the night (Into the night)

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard, now baby
Rider of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Rider of the sky
Dartin' like a dream come true, star bright

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom
Up into the air

Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard, now baby

Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Rider of the sky
Dartin' like a dream come true, star bright

Was born to fly
Into the night

Into the night (Into the night)

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard, now baby
Rider of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright
Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Rider of the sky
Dartin' like a dream come true, star bright
