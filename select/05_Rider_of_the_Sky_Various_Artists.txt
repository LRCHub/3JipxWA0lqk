I am a rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I am a rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss your daddy, rollin' in your arms
Sun's gonna shine in your back door someday
Sun's gonna shine in your back door someday
And the wind from the river's gonna blow your blues away
I am a rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I am a rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss your daddy, rollin' in your arms
You're gonna miss your daddy, rollin' in your arms
